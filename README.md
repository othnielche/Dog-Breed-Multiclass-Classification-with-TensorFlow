## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to accurately identify the breed of a dog from an input image. This involves building a multi-class classifier that can distinguish between 120 different dog breeds.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification competition. It includes over 10,000 labeled images for training and a similar number of unlabeled images for testing.

The dataset can be accessed and downloaded from [Kaggle's competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data).

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to predict the correct breed for each image in the test set. The output is a file containing prediction probabilities for each dog breed.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes TensorFlow for building the image classifier.
- **Transfer Learning:** Applies transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency.
- **Multi-Class Classification:** Capable of classifying images into 120 different dog breeds.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model:
   """ bash
   jupyter notebook dog-vision.ipynb
   """"
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Results 

The model achieves high accuracy in identifying dog breeds and produces a CSV file with prediction probabilities for each test image.
